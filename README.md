RubyTetris
===========

One of my more interesting homeworks where we had to extend traditional tetris
from an existing bare bones version, built with the TK library. Pretty fun.

*To build:*
-----------
- Get RVM. This tells you how to do it:
http://octopress.org/docs/setup/rvm/
- Get ActiveTCL 8.5 from:
from.http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads
- Get Ruby, then:  
 `rvm reinstall ruby-2.2 --with-tcl --with-tk`
- Now you can run the game by:
  `ruby runner.rb [enhanced | original]`
